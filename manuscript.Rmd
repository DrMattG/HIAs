# Introduction
SEEA EA principles

The need for local field data

Low data availability

Fast turn around with automated workflows

4 types of indicator

# Material and Methods 

In this study we focused on open mire ecosystems in Norway.
For this ecosystem we have an ecosystem delineation map produced using remotely sensed data and  
a deep learning model.
This model had a XX% precision when tested against independent field data.

The reference state defining ecosystems in optimal or pristine condition is defined as one with little or no human influence, with a climate as in the period 1961-1990 and a native species similar as today (i.ei no mammoths allowed).

We then identified two _ecosystem condition characteristics_ that, along with many other characteristics that we do not specify here, define the typical behavior of open mire ecosystems in the reference condition: 

- Species composition
- Vegetation intactness

To describe these two concepts we use five condition variables from the same data set (ref).
The five variables are:


1. 7FK (prevalence of alien species)
1. 7SE (tracks from large vehicles)
1. 7TK (human caused abration or abration-caused erosion)
1. PRTK (same as 7TK, but recorded at a higher resolution)
1. PRSL (same as 7SE, but recorded at a higher resolution)

Varaibles 1-3 are defined in Halvorsen and Bratli 2019.
Variables 4 and 5 are defined in ...


The data set from a standardised field survey of nature types in Norway (REF).
Each locality is scored on a range of variables relevant for describing the state and quality of nature.
The surveys are comissioned with the goal of producing data relevant for immediate land-use decisions, and is therefore
spatially biased, typically towards areas with high human impact or expected impact.

Variable 1 was planned to be developed into a single indicator (i.e. a normalised variable) with the same name.
Variables 2-5 describe very related aspects as so they where planned to be combined into a composite indicator called antropogenic disturbance to soil and vegetation so ADSV or short. 

Alien plant cover was assigned to ECT class B1a - Compositional state characteristics
ADSV was assigned to ECT class A1 - physical ...



National indicator and for about 4 municipalities as a case study
