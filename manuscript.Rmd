# Introduction
SEEA EA principles

The need for local field data

Low data availability

Fast turn around with automated workflows

4 types of indicator

# Material and Methods 

In this study we focused on open mire ecosystems in Norway.
For this ecosystem we have an ecosystem delineation map produced using a  
a deep learning model which was trained on field verified ground truth data and and satellite imagery. 
This model had a XX% precision when tested against independent field data.

The reference state defining ecosystems in optimal or pristine condition is defined as one with little or no human influence, with a climate as in the period 1961-1990 and a native species similar as today (no mammoths allowed).

We then identified two _concepts_ that define open mire ecosystems in optimal condition: 

- Native species dominate
- No physical damage caused by human activities

To describe these two concepts we use five condition variables from the same data set (ref).
The five variables are:


1. Alien plant cover
1. 7SE
1. 7TK
1. PR..
1. PR..

The data set from a standardised field survey of nature types.
Each locality is scored on a range of variables relevant for describing the state and quality of nature.
The surveys are comissioned with the goal of producing rel spatially  

Variable 1 was planned to be developed into a single indicator (i.e. a normalised variable) with the same name.
Variables 2-5 describe very related aspects as so they where planned to be combined into a composite indicator called antropogenic disturbance to soil and vegetation so ADSV or short. 

Alien plant cover was assigned to ECT class B1a - Compositional state characteristics
ADSV was assigned to ECT class A1 - physical ...



National indicator and for about 4 municipalities as a case study

Validation/sensitivity analyses (varying HIA resolution and minimum _n_?)

Schematic GIS workflow
